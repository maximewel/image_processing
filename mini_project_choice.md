As a note - I am sorry for the delay. I planned on submitting my choices on Friday 11th, but I got a nasty Covid/Flue vaccination that downed me for the whole day :(
As I am late, I understand that some choices might already be taken so I submit 2 alternatives

# Choose your project (optinaly with an alternative), and inform us if you it alone or in binome (text file on ILLIAS)

I would like to do the project alone

* First choice: Counting bacteria. I like the concept and the dataset and I have a few Ideas that I want to try and compare (equalization, binarisation, open/close, circle detection/segmentation)
* Auxiliary choices:
	* Binarisation - Not very creative but I love algorithms
	* Landscape detection - More creative / challenging, but seems very hard to have good consistent results considering the dataset
