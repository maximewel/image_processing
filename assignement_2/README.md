Brief desc: Assignement 2's objective is to play with colormaps by creating one and encoding an image in a Cmap with a max of 256 colors

Where to find the files:
The work is done in the jupyter notebook
The /out folder has 
* the original Lena image (lena_orig.png)
* the image encoded with the Cmap as an image (lena_indexed.png)
* The image necoded with the Cmap as its indexes (indexedImage.txt)
* the Cmap as an image (cmap.png)
* The cmap as 256 RGB colors (cmap.txt)

Algo: The algorithm is explained in depth in the jupyter notebook and is rather simple. By starting the notebook, the encoding can be done in all the images of the input folder by adding the image names in the code.
