# Trials

This folder contains a non-reviewed / raw version of the different experiments made in the scope of the bactery detection miniproject. \
Each experiment is a new jupyter notebook testing one or multiple mecanisms, or a new combination of mecanisms. The name of the notebooks tries to be explicit concerning its content.

# Utilization

Those notebooks are note made to create persisent information and therefore do not save any images / file. They are made to be runned as stand-alones scripts and the results are directly below the code snippets.\
The notebooks are for only for testing purpose and finding a good combination, they do not produce quantizied results (efficiency, run time...)
